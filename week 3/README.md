# Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis in R / Concept Generation
This week we begin the design concept phase and also continue with data exploration/ analysis in R. We will be joined by Michael Treglia (from The Nature Conservancy) and Kate Kryder (from Northeasternâ€™s Research Data Services group) to speak about their visualization process and also discuss working with spatial data in R for creating maps.

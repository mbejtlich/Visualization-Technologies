# Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis in R
In this workshop, we will cover the basics of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in R, including data preparation, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Through this process we will learn to explore the data through the lens of our research question/project idea, and uncover possibly new patterns and the relationships in the data. EDA will inform your final visualization concept.       

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Identify data sources 
- Import and convert data in R Studio 
- Clean data and perform quality check
- Explore numerical distributions 
- Explore categorical distributions
- Create visualizations summarizing your findings, with insights annotated in text 

## Data sources
There are a few data formats that are standardized for computer to read. 

### CSV
- Also known as *Comma-separated Values*. 
- A text file which uses commas to seperate values, which each line holding a data record 
– Structured data type
- Simple and easy to use in programs
- Additional explanation [What Is a CSV File? Guide to Uses and Benefits](https://flatfile.io/blog/what-is-a-csv-file-guide-to-uses-and-benefits)

### JSON 
- Also known as *JavaScript Object Notation*.
- Used for storing, serializing, and transporting structured data.
- At a top level, it is a dictionary with key/value pairs
– Semi-structured data type
- Additional explanation [Mozilla: Working with JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)

### XML
- Also knonwn as *EXtensible Markup Language*
- Markup language without no predefined tags.
– Semi-structured data type
- Simple text-based format for representing structured information: documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices, and much more
- Additional explanation [Mozilla: XML introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction)

### Other filetype (unstructured data) 
- Photos, videos, sounds, text files, PDFs, ect.
